Lokanatha Swami was born in Aravade, a small village Maharashtra, India. He pursued his secondary education from Wellington College, Sangli and moved to Bombay to study Chemistry at Kirti College. In the year 1971, after meeting A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and his western disciples at a preaching program in Mumbai, he "forsook his study of chemistry in favour of studying the Bhagavad Gita" and joined ISKCON. He took sannyasa (renounced order of life) in 1975.[4] In 1976 he inaugurated the Padayatra walking pilgrimage tour of India where, together with a group of Hare Krishna devotees, a cart and religious books, "he treaded his way on foot across India, preaching the knowledge of sanatana dharma".[4] In 1989 he inaugurated the same preaching program in America.[9] Since then, Padayatra has become instrumental in propagation of Krishna consciousness.[10] In 1986 Lokanatha Swami was appointed an initiating guru in ISKCON.[11] In 1996 he was responsible for organising a celebration of 100th Anniversary of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in India.
